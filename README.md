## Technologies
Project is created with:
* terminal-kit: 2.4.0
  * This is the package I used for listening for input in the terminal and rendering text with different styles and colors
  * I chose this specific package because it seemed to be one of the most widely used, with the best documentation and was well maintained
* lodash: ^4.17.21
  * I used this package to type check for error handling purposes 
* fs: 0.0.1-security
  * I used this to write and read to a json file as a means of 'persistant' storage 
* mocha: ^10.0.0
* chai: ^4.3.6
  * I used the above two packages for writing basic unit tests and I chose them becasue i felt theyre solutions fit my use case and the syntax is very intuitive 
* eslint: ^8.20.0
* eslint-config-airbnb-base: ^15.0.0
  * The above two packages were used to enforce code style and format
